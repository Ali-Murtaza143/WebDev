    <!-- Semantic HTML
    Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the code we write. Before Semantic 
    HTML the elements didnâ€™t have any meaning as to what it does or what content goes in it. An element such as 
    <div> was used as a general-purpose element to create things from headers to footers to articles. With Semantic 
        HTML we were introduced to elements that tell developers and browsers exactly what it does and what content should go in it. -->

        <!--Non Semantic HTML-->
<div id="footer">
    <p>this is a footer</p>
   </div>
   
   <!--Semantic HTML-->
   <footer>
    <p>this is a footer</p>
   </footer>

<!-- 
   Embedding media
Semantic HTML introduces us to <video>, <audio> and <embed>. <video> allows us to add videos to our website. 
<audio> allows us to implement audio into our website. <embed> can be used to implement any type of media. 
These elements are universal in that they all use the src attribute to link the source of the content. 
<video> and <audio> requires a closing tag while <embed> is a self-closing tag.
 -->


<!--Video Tag-->
<video src="4kvideo.mp4">video not supported</video>

<!--Audio Tag-->
<audio src="koreanhiphop.mp3"></audio>

<!--Embed tag-->
<embed src="babyyoda.gif"/>


<!-- 

<figure> and <figcaption>
    The <figure> element is used to encapsulate media such as an image, diagram. or code snippet. The <figcaption> element is 
    used to describe the media encapsulated within the <figure> element. Developers will normally use <figcaption> within the 
    <figure> element to group the media and description. This way, if a developer decides to change the position of the media, 
    the description will follow along with it. -->

<figure>
        <img src="qwerty.jpg">
<figcaption>The image shows the layout of a qwerty keyboard.</figcaption>
</figure>
